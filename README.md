# Homework

This is a repo of my programming basics homework (and also lab work for other stuff).

Here's a duck 🦆.

I highly recommend my peers not to use the code I have put here, as that does not 
conform to UCU's standards of academic integrity. You have been warned

Also here's bread for the duck 🍞.
